Temperature is a physical quantity that expresses quantitatively the perceptions of hotness and coldness. Temperature is measured with a thermometer.

Humidity is a measure of the amount of water vapor in the air. Relative humidity measures the amount of water in the air in relation to the maximum amount of water vapor (moisture). The higher the temperature, the more water vapor the air can hold.

The heat index, also known as the apparent temperature, is what the temperature feels like to the human body when relative humidity is combined with the air temperature.  This has important considerations for the human body's comfort. 

When the body gets too hot, it begins to perspire or sweat to cool itself off.

COMPONENTS USED:
Arduino UNO:

Is a low-cost, flexible, and easy-to-use programmable open-source microcontroller board.

DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor

The DHT-11 Digital Temperature And Humidity Sensor is a basic, ultra-low-cost digital temperature and humidity sensor


16×2 LCD Screen

A 16x2 LCD means it can display 16 characters per line and there are 2 such lines.
Circuit Diagram:- 

A Temperature Humidity Predictometer is constructed using a very significant device the DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor. Inside the DHT11, there is a thermistor with a humidity sensor component.The humidity sensor component consists of two electrodes containing a dehydrated substrate sandwich.The ions are released into the substrate as water vapor absorbs it, which in turn increases the conductivity between the electrodes.
Thus, this is how we can detect Temperature and Humidity.
